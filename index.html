      <p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails application from scratch. It does not
        assume that you have any prior experience with Rails.</p>
      <p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience
        with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists
        of online resources for learning Ruby:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Official Ruby Programming Website</a></li>
        <li><a href="">List of Free Programming Books</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover older versions of Ruby, and may not include some
        syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.</p>

      <header id="what_is_rails">2 What is Rails?</header>
      <article>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed
        to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get
        started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.
        Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</article>
      <article>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's
        designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way"
        you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other
        languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy
        experience.</article>
      <p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Repeat Yourself:</strong> DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every
          piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". By not
          writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less
          buggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Over Configuration:</strong> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web
          application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through
          endless configuration files.</li>
      </ul>

      <header id="creating_a_new_rails_project">3 Creating a New Rails Project</header>
      <p>The best way to read this guide is to follow it step by step. All steps are essential to run this example
        application and no additional code or steps are needed.</p>
      <p>By following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called blog, a (very) simple weblog. Before
        you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.</p>

      <div class="mini-container">
        <article>The examples below use <span>$</span> to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS, though it
          may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows, your prompt will look something like
          <span>C:\source_code></span>.
        </article>
      </div>
      <h3>3.1 Installing Rails</h3>
      <p>Before you install Rails, you should check to make sure that your system has the proper prerequisites
        installed. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <li>SQLite3</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Yarn</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3.1.1 Installing Ruby</h3>
      <article>Open up a command line prompt. On macOS open Terminal.app; on Windows choose "Run" from your Start menu
        and type cmd.exe. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you
        have a current version of Ruby installed:</article>

      <div class="mini-container-2">
        <p style="color: rgb(13, 13, 153);">$ <span style="color: rgb(107, 107, 216);">ruby</span> --version</p>
        <p style="color: grey;">ruby 2.5.0</p>
      </div>
      <p>Rails requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or later. If the version number returned is less than that number (such as
        2.3.7, or 1.8.7), you'll need to install a fresh copy of Ruby.</p>
      <p>To install Rails on Windows, you'll first need to install <a href="">Ruby Installer.</a></p>
      <p>For more installation methods for most Operating Systems take a look at <a href="">ruby-lang.org.</a></p>

      <p>To begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to get your Rails application
        server running.</p>
      <h3>4.1 Starting up the Web Server</h3>
      <p>You actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your
        development machine. You can do this by running the following command in the blog directory:</p>
      <div class="mini-container-2 mini">
        <p>$ <span style="color: rgb(107, 107, 216);">bin/rails</span> server</p>
