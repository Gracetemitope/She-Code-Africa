    <p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails.</p>
    <p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">Official Ruby Programming Website</a></li>
      <li><a href="">List of Free Programming Books</a></li>

    </ul>
    <p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover older versions of Ruby, and may not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.</p>

      <article>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</article>
      <article>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</article>
      <p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Repeat Yourself:</strong> DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Over Configuration:</strong> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
      </ul>
